# Domotz Light
A smart Wi-Fi Lamp for Home Assistant that can be controlled also with a rotary encoder.

The goal of this project is to use EspHome on a ESP8266 module (such as NodeMcu or Wemos D1 Mini) to create a smart Lamp with WS2812 or SK6812 led strips that can be controller either via Home Assistant or locally with a rotary encoder.
